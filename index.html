                          Roman epigraphy is an intriguing legacy of the Roman civilization.
                          Whereas historiography often focuses on the great men who shaped history, inscriptions, on the other hand, reveal a broader reality. They provide a glimpse into the lives of ordinary people and local communities.
                          The men who commissioned these inscriptions often wanted to immortalize their achievements, taking pride in listing their position and/or the regiment they had served in. With just a few lines, we can reconstruct the history of a person and their life.

                          Ancient Roman inscriptions are usually found in ancient cities, but some can also be found in Venice, even though the city itself was born in the Middle Ages! Why is that?

                          This is a question that many scholars have wondered about. The phenomenon of reuse is very old, but in this case, the shortage of raw materials does not seem to be the main reason. This is suggested by the fact that the inscriptions were often placed in plain sight on the walls of buildings. It’s likely that Venice, lacking the ancient past of many other Italian cities, sought to enhance its prestige by incorporating these relics.
                          But do these inscriptions still serve that purpose today, or are they overlooked by passers-by?
                </p>
                <p>
                          This project aims to answer that question.
                          I will first present three epigraphs from the ancient city of <em>Altinum</em> and share their stories. I will also discuss the results of a survey I conducted among passers-by, using the findings to explore how much these inscriptions remain present in the modern collective imagination.

                <h2>The inscription of Fronto</h2>
                    <p>
                        The epigraph, first documented in the 16th century, still resides in the church of San Vidal, where it can be seen partly embedded in the church tower and partly exposed on the exterior. It stands as a silent witness to the life of Cnaeus Numerius Fronto, a man whose story intertwines military service, social ascension, and the enduring bonds of patronage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fronto began his career as a horseman (eques) in the Roman military, earning an honorable discharge (honesta missio) that marked him as a respected veteran (veteranus). Upon completing his service, he was granted an estate in Altinum, a common reward for Roman veterans, reflecting the empire’s practice of securing loyalty through land ownership. In this flourishing city, Fronto’s post-military life saw him rise through the ranks to become one of its most distinguished politicians, leaving a legacy of civic leadership.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fronto’s foresight extended beyond his life. He entrusted his burial arrangements to three freedmen (liberti): Cnaeus Numerius Felix, Crescens, and Tuendus. The bond between master and freedman is evident in their shared names; Felix, like many freed slaves, adopted the first two names of his former master, signifying his integration into Fronto’s household and patronage.
                        Felix’s story, in particular, exemplifies the social mobility that Roman society could offer. Once enslaved, he gained not only freedom but also prominence, assuming a significant role for a freedman. He organized the city’s games and spectacles—events that were much more than mere entertainment. Such public celebrations, funded by the organizer, elevated their status and secured the admiration of the community. To take on this role, Felix would have needed substantial wealth, indicating his success and the enduring influence of his former master’s patronage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Together, Fronto’s achievements and the rise of his freedmen offer a vivid glimpse into the interconnected lives of Roman veterans, citizens, and former slaves. The epigraph thus speaks not only to individual accomplishments but also to the intricate social fabric of Altinum, where loyalty, ambition, and public service shaped the contours of Roman identity.

                <h2>The inscription of Faustus</h2>
                    <p>
                        The altar, documented in 18th-century manuscripts, is believed to have originated in Altino and has remained housed in a building near the church of Santa Maria Formosa to this day. Though weathered by time, it offers a fascinating glimpse into Roman funerary traditions and the social bonds that transcended servitude.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Regrettably, the upper section of the altar is no longer visible, leaving us unable to determine whether it features the typical recessed niche of an altar-ossuary. These recesses, a hallmark of such monuments, were spaces where Romans honored their departed loved ones with offerings, libations, or sacred objects. They served as enduring connections between the living and the dead, ensuring that memory and reverence continued even beyond the grave.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This particular monument, however, sets itself apart with its unusual focus on the role of freedmen. Unlike many similar cases, where the former master’s name and status dominate the narrative, here the master is mentioned only in passing. Instead, the spotlight falls on a single freedman, who chose to memorialize two of his former comrades at his own expense. All three individuals had shared the same master in life, yet it is the bond between the freedmen, not their relationship with the master, that defines this monument.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The inscription thus offers a rare and touching insight into the affection and camaraderie that could develop among former slaves. Freed from servitude, they remained connected through shared experiences, mutual respect, and a sense of solidarity. This act of commemoration speaks not only to the freedman’s generosity but also to the profound relationships that could persist beyond the constraints of their former status.

                        The altar, even in its incomplete state, is a testament to the complexity of Roman social structures and the enduring humanity of those who navigated them. It stands as a reminder that even in a rigidly hierarchical society, bonds of loyalty and friendship could transcend the divisions of class and status, leaving behind stories that resonate across the centuries.
