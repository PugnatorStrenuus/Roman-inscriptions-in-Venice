                <h2>The inscription of Fronto</h2>
                    <p>
                        The epigraph, first documented in the 16th century, still resides in the church of San Vidal, where it can be seen partly embedded in the church tower and partly exposed on the exterior. It stands as a silent witness to the life of Cnaeus Numerius Fronto, a man whose story intertwines military service, social ascension, and the enduring bonds of patronage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fronto began his career as a horseman (eques) in the Roman military, earning an honorable discharge (honesta missio) that marked him as a respected veteran (veteranus). Upon completing his service, he was granted an estate in Altinum, a common reward for Roman veterans, reflecting the empire’s practice of securing loyalty through land ownership. In this flourishing city, Fronto’s post-military life saw him rise through the ranks to become one of its most distinguished politicians, leaving a legacy of civic leadership.

                    <p>
                        Fronto’s foresight extended beyond his life. He entrusted his burial arrangements to three freedmen (liberti): Cnaeus Numerius Felix, Crescens, and Tuendus. The bond between master and freedman is evident in their shared names; Felix, like many freed slaves, adopted the first two names of his former master, signifying his integration into Fronto’s household and patronage.
                        Felix’s story, in particular, exemplifies the social mobility that Roman society could offer. Once enslaved, he gained not only freedom but also prominence, assuming a significant role for a freedman. He organized the city’s games and spectacles—events that were much more than mere entertainment. Such public celebrations, funded by the organizer, elevated their status and secured the admiration of the community. To take on this role, Felix would have needed substantial wealth, indicating his success and the enduring influence of his former master’s patronage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Together, Fronto’s achievements and the rise of his freedmen offer a vivid glimpse into the interconnected lives of Roman veterans, citizens, and former slaves. The epigraph thus speaks not only to individual accomplishments but also to the intricate social fabric of Altinum, where loyalty, ambition, and public service shaped the contours of Roman identity.
